                        Museo Taller Jose Clemente Orozco harbors PAOS GDL,
                        this house was the last artist’ studio. Built by the
                        engineer Edmundo Ponce Adame accordance to Orozco’s
                        specifications and needs, the house was finished in
                        1949 and is where he planned to live his last years.
                        This workshop was the second that Orozco had in Guadalajara.<br><br>
                        The first one, located in Lopez Cotilla #814 was where he
                        lived while he made the murals for the Paraninfo of the
                        Guadalajara University and Hospicio Cabañas. He sold it
                        before acquiring the ground in Aurelio Aceves. Museo
                        Taller José Clemente Orozco was inaugurated in 1951 as
                        the first museum dedicated to an artist in Mexico.<br><br>
                        Clemente Orozco Valladares, painter’s son, mentions
                        that his father designed his two studios in Guadalajara
                        and in Mexico City. In the book José Clemente Orozco,
                        Alma Reed mentions that “the artist put in service his
                        early architecture early practices that he learned during
                        his 3 years in the Agricultura de San Jacinto school, when
                        planning and designing the three floor building”.<br><br>
                         Even though
                        the original design was made by José Clemente Orozco, the
                        building was modified with the intervention of the civil
                        engineer Edmundo Ponce Adame, who did all the calculation
                        and the supervision of the architectonic work. The final
                        design was, a mixture of Orozco’s styles and Ponce Adame’s;
                        respecting the construction and the engineer said: “The design
                        was mine, but following the instructions of the master, he said:
                        I want a living room here. We adjusted to the possibilities and
                        the final design resulted, the most important part is the proper
                        studio, José Clemente didn’t give much importance to the rest and
                        he set the dimensions, he said: I want it to have 9.50 free meters
                        high” It isn’t certain the exact date when José Clemente Orozco
                        started to inhabit the Casa Taller, but by late may 1949, before
                        it was finished, he already lived in it in an itinerant way, he
                        came and went from Mexico City to Guadalajara continuously.<br><br>
                        Museo Taller The creation of Museo Taller was accomplished
                        due to the inspiration and wishes of Margarita Valladares,
                        Orozco’s widow, who understood the importance of the
                        composition of her husband’s work. She took care of managing
                        all the needs of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes and
                        Jalisco’s state government for the enrichment of the mexican
                        patrimony spreading the pictoric work and the important features
                        of his personal life.
